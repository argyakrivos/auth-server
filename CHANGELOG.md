# Zuul Server Change Log

## 0.17.1 ([#139](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/139) 2015-01-23 11:32:35)

Reduce chance of developer not using thin

patch

## 0.17.0 ([#138](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/138) 2014-12-16 17:17:12)

Updated the auth server to use Graylog

### New features

- Logs all messages to Graylog instead of to log files

### Notes

- Removed the logging of timing information to files as we now get this
from New Relic.

## 0.16.0 ([#137](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/137) 2014-12-03 11:44:25)

Added identifiers to #sendEmail message

### New features

- Now sends the user identifier in the #sendEmail message as this is
required by ExactTarget to send mails via the API.

## 0.15.7 ([#136](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/136) 2014-10-24 15:40:15)

CP-1998: Fixed an intermittent bug where user_details where not there

### Bug fixes

- `after_created` would be called regardless of whether the entity was saved or not. That would send a reporting message before the actual data has been committed to the database.

## 0.15.6 ([#135](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/135) 2014-10-20 12:05:44)

Bugfix newrelic config and feature addition for new environments

Bug fix newrelic config

Date/Expires date format changes

- The Date and Expires headers are now returned in the correct HTTP
date format.

## 0.15.4 ([#133](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/133) 2014-10-16 10:00:41)

Database reconnects when disconnected

### Bug fixes

- Now automatically reconnects to the database if the connection is
dropped (e.g. by the database being restarted).

## 0.15.3 ([#132](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/132) 2014-10-14 12:40:50)

Fix to SSO proxying to forward emails with a different case to forwarded_domains

#### Patch
* Ensuring both `@forwarded_domains` and the user's email address are downcase so forwarding by email address is no longer case sensitive.



## 0.15.2 ([#129](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/129) 2014-09-05 09:23:05)

Fix tests

#### Test improvement to fix some of the test failures when running out of process against DevInt
* Clearing the HTTParty proxy. This issue was highlighted when a preceding test used (the currently blocked) wonderproxy.com, the following tests would use the same proxy unintentionally since the proxy was not being cleared on initialisation.  
* Ignoring some tests/steps when running out of process because they rely on the server running in-process, and having the SendsMessagetoFakeQueues module loaded in.
* Fixing some failing tests due to a bug in cucumber where the Background doesn't get run for a Scenario Outline when the Scenario Outline is not first. The fix is currently in a beta version of cucumber, see https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/issues/560

## 0.15.1 ([#131](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/131) 2014-09-24 15:03:36)

Fix forwarding logic for SSO delegation

### Bugfix

This patch will fix issues caused my lack of ruby-magic and will allow zuul to correctly delegate some requests to another server (i.e. auth-service) based on the provided configuration.

## 0.15.0 ([#130](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/130) 2014-09-19 14:55:19)

Introduce better settings for sso forwarding

### New feature

* Allow the configuration of which username domains have to be forwarded to another service for authentication.

## 0.14.0 ([#128](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/128) 2014-08-18 15:25:51)

Added the ability to proxy SSO requests

### New features

- Can now proxy requests from employees to a delegate auth server

## 0.13.9 ([#127](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/127) 2014-08-18 12:22:30)

Patch for running against DevInt on CI

Patch for running against DevInt on CI:

* Simplify and merge cucumber.yml config files
* Empty results/ folder so CI jobs don't complain when ran
* Don't run steps that rely on in-process monkey-patching when targeting external instances
* Some minor whitespace cleanup

## 0.13.8 ([#126](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/126) 2014-08-06 11:16:35)

Update cucumber config

Test improvement - new cucumber profiles
This change is so we can run the tests out of process against the DevInt environment


## 0.13.7 ([#121](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/121) 2014-08-01 10:52:54)

Application & Reference Config; specify keys directory

### Improvements

- Moved configuration to `config/reference.properties` (for sane defaults) and `config/application.properties` (for environment specific settings)
- Included a `config/testing.properties` for the test environment (The application being tested will still load `config/application.properties`!)
- Added new config `auth.keysPath` which is the location where keys should be searched for.

## 0.13.6 ([#125](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/125) 2014-08-04 10:29:12)

New Relic Log file location

### Improvement

- Moved the location of the new relic logfile to an ops-approved location.

## 0.13.5 ([#124](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/124) 2014-08-04 08:52:25)

No need for MySQL2 adapter

- Don't need the MySQL2 adapter gem listed explicitly any more.

## 0.13.4 ([#123](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/123) 2014-08-04 08:39:48)

HA! You little bastard. You depend on MySQL shared libraries

### Bug fix

- We need to make sure the RPM depends on the shared MySQL libraries. Woop!

Removed sqlite3 dependency

### Improvements

- Removed sqlite3 dependency as it isn't used and means the CI server configuration would need to be changed to support it if we keep it.

## 0.13.1 ([#105](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Zuul/zuul-server/pull/105) 2014-07-21 08:25:22)
